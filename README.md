# Fall Risk Prediction Model

A machine learning model for predicting fall risk in patients using demographic, medical, and physiological data. This project implements and compares multiple algorithms to identify high-risk patients for fall prevention interventions.

## üéØ Project Overview

Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults and patients with certain medical conditions. This predictive model analyzes patient data to identify individuals at high risk of falling, enabling proactive interventions and improved patient safety.

## üìä Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset of 2,000 patient records with the following features:

### Demographics
- Age
- Gender
- BMI

### Vital Signs
- Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
- Heart rate

### Medical Conditions
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Arthritis
- Depression
- Cognitive impairment
- Previous falls history

### Additional Features
- Assistive device usage (None, Cane, Walker, Wheelchair)
- Number of medications

## üî¨ Model Development

### Algorithm Comparison

Six different algorithms were evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation:

| Model | ROC AUC | F1 Score |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **AdaBoost** | **0.9412** | **0.7934** |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9342 | 0.7597 |
| SVM | 0.9295 | 0.7537 |
| Random Forest | 0.9265 | 0.7425 |
| XGBoost | 0.9246 | 0.7681 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9236 | 0.7359 |

**AdaBoost** emerged as the top performer with the highest ROC AUC and F1 score.

### Feature Importance

The most influential features in the AdaBoost model:

| Feature | Importance |
|---------|------------|
| Age | 51.1% |
| Previous falls | 22.2% |
| Number of medications | 13.8% |
| Cognitive impairment | 6.4% |
| Systolic BP | 3.2% |
| Assistive device | 2.4% |

## üìà Model Performance

### Final Model Metrics (Test Set)
- **Accuracy**: 82%
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: 88% - Successfully identifies 88% of actual fall cases
- **Specificity**: 80% - Correctly identifies 80% of non-fall cases
- **F1-Score**: 0.75 - Good balance between precision and recall
- **ROC AUC**: 0.92 - Excellent discriminative ability

### Confusion Matrix
- True Negatives: 224
- False Positives: 56
- False Negatives: 15
- True Positives: 105

### Clinical Significance
- **High Sensitivity**: Only 12% of true fall cases are missed
- **Negative Predictive Value**: 94% of patients predicted as low-risk truly don't fall
- **False Alarm Rate**: 20.4% of non-fallers flagged as high-risk

## ‚öñÔ∏è Handling Class Imbalance

The model addresses the natural imbalance in fall data using:

- **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**: Generates synthetic samples focusing on hard-to-learn fall cases
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search with 5-fold cross-validation for optimal performance

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations
